# My Personal Website

This is my personal website, built using Astro. It is a work in progress.
Used Tailwwind CSS for styling with the typography plugin to properly format markdown text.
Used React with Shadcn/ui for components.
Used Preline UI for the timeline component.

This website is designed to be fast and lightweight, with a focus on performance and accessibility.
React is used only for certain components.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of this Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ui/ (Shadcn/ui components)
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Footer.astro
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Header.astro
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Timeline.astro
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Tsx Components (React components)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ MainLayout.astro
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ NewsLayout.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ news/ (News pages)
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ experience.astro
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ projects.astro
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ thenews.astro
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ styles/ (Tailwind CSS)
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ other configuration files
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
